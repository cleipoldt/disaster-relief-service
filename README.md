# Disaster Relief Service (ENSF 380)

Java domain classes and JUnit tests created for an in-class ENSF 380 assignment at the University of Calgary.

This repository focuses on examining, validating, and testing object-oriented designs rather than delivering a complete runnable application. The emphasis was on code quality, unit tests, and correctness.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

This project was developed specifically as a testing-focused coursework exercise. Students were expected to:

- Inspect and reason about existing Java classes
- Test the code with given test files
- Validate object-oriented structure and behavior
- Identify defects and edge cases

A standalone UI or executable program was **not** part of the assignment.
